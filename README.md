# genome-sequencing
This repo contains code implementing some algorithms, presented in Course 2: Genome Sequencing from the Bioinformatics specialization by UCSD on Coursera.
It contains code, related to DeBruijn graphs, Euler cycles and paths, as well as universal circular string, etc.
If one is interested in testing the code, they can do so by downloading some test sets from Rosalind.
